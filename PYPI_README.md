# ejpm

**ejpm** stands for **e**<sup>**J**ANA</sup> **p**acket ~~**m**anager~~ helper

**The main goal** of ejpm is to provide easy experience of:

* installing e<sup>JANA</sup> reconstruction framework and dependent packages
* unify installation for different environments: various operating systems, docker images, etc. 

The secondary goal is to help users with e^JANA plugin development cycle.



### Motivation

**ejpm** is here as there is no standard convention in HEP and NP of how to distribute and install software packages 
with its dependencies. Some packages (like eigen, xerces, etc.) are usually supported by 
OS maintainers, while others (Cern ROOT, Geant4, Rave) are usually built by users or 
other packet managers and could be located anywhere. Here comes "version hell" multiplied by lack of software manpower 
(e.g. to continuously maintain packages on distros level or even to fix GitHub issues) 
Still we love our users and try to get things easier for them!
So here is ejpm.


At this points **ejpm** tries to unify experience and make it simple to deploy eJANA for:

- Users on RHEL 7 and CentOS
- Users on Ubutnu (and Windows with WSL) \*\*
- Docker and other containers


It should be as easy as:

```bash
> ejpm find all            # try to automatically find dependent packets* 
> ejpm --top-dir=/opt/eic  # set where to install missing packets
> ejpm install all         # build and install missing packets
```

It also provides a possibility to fine control over dependencies

```bash
> ejpm set root /opt/root6_04_16           # manually add cern ROOT location to use
> ejpm rebuild jana && ejpm rebuild ejana  # rebuild* packets after it 
```

> \* - (!) 'find' and 'rebuild' commands are not yet implemented  
> \*\* -  macOS is upcoming


**ejpm** is not: 

1. It is not a real package manager, which automatically solves dependencies
2. **ejpm is not a requirment** for e<sup>JANA</sup>. It is not a part of e<sup>JANA</sup> 
    build system and one can compile and install e<sup>JANA</sup> without ejpm   


## Get ejana installed

(or crash course to ejpm)

***TL;DR;*** example for CentOS/RHEL7
```bash
ejpm req fedora ejana         # get list of OS packets required to build jana and deps
sudo yum install ...          # install watever 'ejpm req' shows
ejpm --top-dir=<where-to>     # Directory where packets will be installed
ejpm set root `$ROOTSYS`      # if you have CERN.ROOT. Or skip this step
ejpm install ejana --missing  # install ejana and dependencies (like genfit, jana and rave)
source<(ejpm env)             # set environment variables
```


Step by step explained instruction:

1. Install (or check) required packages form OS:

    ```bash
    ejpm req ubuntu         # for all packets that ejpm knows
    ejpm req fedora ejana   # for ejana and its dependencies only
    ```
   
    At this point only ***'ubuntu'*** and ***'fedora'*** are known words for req command. Put: 
    * ***ubuntu*** for debian family 
    * ***fedora*** for RHEL and CentOS systems.

    *In the future this will be updated to support macOS and to have more detailed versions*

2. Set <b><blue>top-dir</blue></b>. This is where all missing packets will be installed.   

    ```bash
    ejpm --top-dir=<where-to-install-all>
    ```
   
3. You may have CERN.ROOT installed (req. version >= 6.14.00). Run this:
    ```bash
    ejpm set root `$ROOTSYS` 
    ```
   
   You may set paths for other installed dependencies combining:  
   ```bash
   ejpm install ejana --missing --explain    # to see missing dependencies
   ejpm set <name> <path>                    # to set dependency path
   ```
   
   Or you may skip this step and just get everything installed by ejpm
   
4. Then you can install ejpm and all missing dependencies:

    ```bash
    ejpm install ejana --missing
    ```

5. Set right environment variables. There are 3 ways for doing this this: 
    
    1. Dynamically source output of ```ejpm env``` command (recommended)
    
        ```bash        
        source <(ejpm env)                # works for bash only
        ```
    2. Save output of ```ejpm env``` command to a file (can be useful)
    
        ```bash
         ejpm env sh  > your-file.sh       # get environment for bash or compatible shells
         ejpm env csh > your-file.csh      # get environment for CSH/TCSH
        ```
    3. Use ejpm generated ```env.sh``` and ```env.csh``` files (lazy and convenient)
    
        ```bash        
        $HOME/.local/share/ejpm/env.sh    # bash and compatible
        $HOME/.local/share/ejpm/env.csh   # for CSH/TCSH
        ```
        (!) The files are regenerated each time ```ejpm <command>``` changes something in EJPM.
        If you change ```db.json``` by yourself, ejpm doesn't track it automatically, so call 'ejpm env'
        to regenerate these 2 files
    

## Environment

 ```EJPM_DATA_PATH```- sets the path where the configuration db.json and env.sh, env.csh are located


Each time you make changes to packets, 
EJPM generates `env.sh` and `env.csh` files, 
that could be found in standard apps user directory.

For linux it is in XDG_DATA_HOME:

```
~/.local/share/ejpm/env.sh      # sh version
~/.local/share/ejpm/env.csh     # csh version
~/.local/share/ejpm/db.json     # open it, edit it, love it
```

> XDG is the standard POSIX paths to store applications data, configs, etc. 
EJPM uses [XDG_DATA_HOME](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/XDG_Base_Directory#Specification)
to store `env.sh`, `env.csh` and `db.json` and ```db.json```

You can always get fresh environment with ejpm ```env``` command 
```bash
ejpm env
```

You can directly source it like:
```bash
source <(ejpm env)
```

You can control where ejpm stores data by setting ```EJPM_DATA_PATH``` environment variable.
